This GitHub repository is a part of a larger overarching homebrew project called [**the Mythril Forge**](https://github.com/mythril-forge).
Just in case you don't know, *homebrew* is more of a colloquial term for unofficial modifications to a game.
This really doesn't have anything to do with bars, brews, or beers.
Sorry!

**The Mythril Forge** a fanmade passion project for the game, [Dungeons &amp; Dragons *(5th Edition)*](https://dnd.wizards.com) by Wizards of the Coast.
Surely you know all about this game if you stumbled here&mdash;and if you somehow didn't, you would have checked out that website!

# Homebrew Spells
This particular repo contains all sorts of specialty homebrew for magic abilities and spells in D&amp;D 5e.
Some of the [most noticeable changes](#changes-to-cantrips) made here include at-will cantrips (level zero spells).
On the other hand, many other spells have been modified only slightly (or not at all).
In this case, they were deemed high enough quality as they were.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, check out the [`spells/`](https://github.com/mythril-forge/homebrew-spells/tree/master/spells) folder!

Specific changes are detailed in each spell's entry.
If a specific entry does not exist, then the spell has either been moved to a different level, renamed, or is no longer available.
In this case, I recommend searching for the spell using GitHub's search bar.

If you find something you dislike, whether its a mechanical opinion or a flourish of english, please [create an issue](https://github.com/mythril-forge/homebrew-spells/issues) on this project!
Better yet&mdash;you can make a change to this project yourself!
Go ahead and fork this project, make changes, then [create a pull request](https://github.com/mythril-forge/homebrew-spells/pulls).

## Bulleted Lists
Some general instructions:
- A line item can be a full sentance.
- If a line item has multiple sentances, it must have a new line.
	The new line is always led by a tab (`\t`) character.
- Occasionally, an item will have further bullet notes itself:
	- It might look like this.
	- Or like this.
		A nested bullet can also have several sentances.
- And these sentances can always be escaped out one way or the other.

Bullets can occasionally take on one or two words (one preferred):
- ice
- fire
- water

You might notice that a bulleted list of any kind is always led by a sentance ending in a colon (`:`).
