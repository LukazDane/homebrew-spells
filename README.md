### Bulleted Lists
Some general instructions:
- A line item can be a full sentance.
- If a line item has multiple sentances, it must have a new line.
	The new line is always led by a tab (`\t`) character.
- Occasionally, an item will have further bullet notes itself:
	- It might look like this.
	- Or like this.
		A nested bullet can also have several sentances.
- And these sentances can always be escaped out one way or the other.

Bullets can occasionally take on one or two words (one preferred):
- ice
- fire
- water

You might notice that a bulleted list of any kind is always led by a sentance ending in a colon (`:`).
