This GitHub repository is a part of a larger overarching homebrew project called [**the Mythril Forge**](https://github.com/mythril-forge).
Just in case you don't know, *homebrew* is more of a colloquial term for unofficial modifications to a game.
This doesn't really have anything to do with booze, bars, or beers.
Sorry!

**The Mythril Forge** a fanmade passion project made for the game, [Dungeons &amp; Dragons *(5th Ed.)*](https://dnd.wizards.com), by Wizards of the Coast.
Surely you know all about this game if you stumbled here&mdash;and if you somehow didn't, you would have checked out that website!

# Homebrew Spells
This particular repo contains all sorts of specialty homebrew for magic spells in D&amp;D 5e.
The data for these spells has been sourced from `5e.tools`.

## Bulleted Lists
Some general instructions:
- A line item can be a full sentance.
- If a line item has multiple sentances, it must have a new line.
	The new line is always led by a tab (`\t`) character.
- Occasionally, an item will have further bullet notes itself:
	- It might look like this.
	- Or like this.
		A nested bullet can also have several sentances.
- And these sentances can always be escaped out one way or the other.

Bullets can occasionally take on one or two words (one preferred):
- ice
- fire
- water

You might notice that a bulleted list of any kind is always led by a sentance ending in a colon (`:`).
