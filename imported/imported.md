#### Legend Lore
*5th-level divination*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 10 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M <br> (incense worth at least 250 sp, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 sp each)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn't of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.

The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: "Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips."

#### Scrying
*5th-level divination*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 10 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M <br> (ten small cut gems and one diamond, together worth at least 250 sp, which the spell consumes; <br> and a focus worth at least 1,000 sp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

<div class="wide">

&emsp;On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the spell creates an array of eleven invisible sensors within 10 feet of the target. The amplified aspects of these sensors allow you to see all around them, smell subtle scents nearby, hear the slightest sounds, or even taste and feel objects close to each sensor. You can otherwise sense through these sensors as if you were in each of their spaces. The many perspectives that you attain allows you to eavesdrop on the most infinitesimal minutiae, invariably noticing each particular detail around the target at every waking moment. These sensors can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.

The sensors move with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see the sensors (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees an array of ten luminous, intangible orbs surrounding them, and one immense, gaping sphere five feet across. These orbs have intricate designs on them akin to eyeballs.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

#### Detect Thoughts
*2nd-level divination*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Area:** 30-foot radius sphere, centered on you
- **Components:** V, S, M (a copper piece worth at least 1 cp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. Your focus on a target ends once it is either out of sight or out of range. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, or attempt to lock onto a creature to probe deeper into its mind. If you choose to probe deeper, you can no longer shift your attention to another creature for the duration of this spell.

When you probe a creature’s deep thoughts, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, its relevant knowledge, and anything that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends, and the target knows that you tried to probe into its mind.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of both its surface and deep thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.

#### Suggestion
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M <br> (a snake's tongue and either a bit <br> of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.
