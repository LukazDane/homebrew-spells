## Description
A 60-foot-long, 15-foot-wide line of furious wind (90 miles per hour) thrusts out from a point of your choice within range in a direction you choose.
The wind lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it (no action required).
The wind fades if its point of origin ever exceeds the spell's range from you or if you cast this spell again.

When the wind appears, each creature in its area must make a Strength Saving Throw or be pushed 15 feet in a direction following the wind.
A creature must repeat this Saving Throw when it moves through the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
At the end of your turn, *medium* or smaller objects within the spell's area that aren't being worn or carried are also pushed in this way.

Any creature in the wind must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves, unless it is moving in the direction of the wind.

The wind disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, or similar unprotected flames in the area.
It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a `50%` chance to extinguish them.
