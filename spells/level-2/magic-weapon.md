Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a `+1` bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.
Additionally, your weapon gains one of the following effects.

### Arcane Energy
Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder, or force.
Until the spell ends, your weapon deals an extra `1d6` damage of the chosen type on a hit.

### Beam Shot
The weapon can be used at range by flinging a magical beam outwards from it.

If this weapon the weapon does not have the *thrown* property, it gains this property with a range out to 20 feet.

When you throw this weapon to make an attack, you can hold onto it so it does not leave your hand&mdash;a glowing afterimage of it will instead fling in its trajectory.

### Magic Ammo
The weapon no longer requires ammo to make attacks, and its *loading* property can be ignored.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to `+2`.
