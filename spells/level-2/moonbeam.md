## Description
A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 120-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range.
Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When a creature moves through the spell's area or ends its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw.
It takes this `2d10` radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
This spell deals an extra `1d10` radiant damage if the moon is visible at the base of the cylinder.

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage.
If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.

Once on each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 2nd.
