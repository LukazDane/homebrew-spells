## Description
You assume a different form.
When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell.
While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

### Aquatic Adaptation
You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers.
You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

### Change Appearance
You transform your appearance.
You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any.
You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change.
You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance.
At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.

### Natural Weapons
You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice.
Your unarmed strikes deal `1d6` bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes.
Alternatively, these appendages can mimic any weapon of your choosing, such as a greatsword or whip.
Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a `+1` magical bonus to the Attack & Damage Rolls you make using it.

### Sprout Wings
You adapt your body for flight, sprouting large, unwieldly wings and losing body weight.
Once on each of your turns, you can use an action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your next turn.
If you don't take this action before the end of your turn while you are aloft, you plummet to the ground.
You can't fly in this way if you are wearing medium or heavy armor.
