## Description
Music of a style you choose fills the air around you, amplifying the immediate notoriety of you and your companions.
The music spreads around corners and can be heard from up to a mile away.
The music moves with you, centered on you for the duration.
Until the spell ends, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a `+10` bonus to Charisma ability checks made to perform before an audience.

In addition, a creature that receives this bonus can use an action on each of their turns to beguile one creature they choose within 30 feet of you that can hear the music.
The creature must make a Charisma saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are hostile to it.
On a failure, the creature becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as it can hear the music.
