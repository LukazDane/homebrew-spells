## Description
You sense the presence of every trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the [*alarm*](../level-1/alarm.md) spell, a [*glyph of warding*](../level-3/glyph-of-warding.md), or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell merely reveals that each trap is present. You don't learn the location of a trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by each trap you sense.
