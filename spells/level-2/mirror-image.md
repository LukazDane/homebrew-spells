## Description
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space.
Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real.
You can dismiss the illusory duplicates at any time (no action required).

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, they must roll a percentile die to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, they must roll more than `75%` or else their attack changes to target a duplicate.
With two duplicates, they must roll more than `66%`.
With one duplicate, they must roll more than `50%`.

A duplicate's AC equals `9 + your Spellcasting modifier`.
If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed.
A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.
It ignores all other damage and effects.
The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.
