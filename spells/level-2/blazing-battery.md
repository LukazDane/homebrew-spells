## Description
You touch a battery of nine projectiles and imbue them with elemental power, which lasts for the duration.
Each projectile must be fungible with the others.
You or someone else can take a projectile and use it in a Weapon Attack.
A projectile can be used normally with a weapon that normally expends ammunition of that kind.
It can also be used as an improvised weapon (unless it's already a weapon).
In either case, a projectile has the following properties:
- A projectile is considered magical (if it isn't already).
- A projectile deals an extra `1d8` fire damage on a hit.

The magic on a projectile dissipates after it is used in an attack.
You can dismiss the magic on any number of projectiles at any time (no action required).
The spell immediately ends if it is cast again before its duration expires, or if there are no more projectiles affected by its magic.
The projectiles lose this magic once the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of projectiles that you can affect with this spell increases by three for each slot level above 2nd.
