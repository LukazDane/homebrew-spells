## Description
You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand.
The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration.
The magic blade has the same statistics as a shortsword with the following changes:
- The sword deals `3d6` fire damage on a hit.
- The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius.

If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.
