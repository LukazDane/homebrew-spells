## Description
You evoke a fiery blade that roars with primal energy.
The blade wreaths your free hand, and lasts for the duration.
The blade has the same statistics as a *scimitar* with the following properties:
- The scimitar sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius.
- The scimitar is considered magical.
- The scimitar deals `3d6` fire damage on a hit.

This spell immediately ends if it is cast again before its duration expires, or if you let go of the scimitar.
The scimitar disappears once the spell ends.
