## Description
You gain the service of a powerful familiar, a divine spirit that hails from another plane of existance.
It becomes your steed.
Typically, familiars come from the Feywild, the Nine Hells, or Elysium.
When you cast this spell for the very first time, this immortal entity is mystically selected and bonded to you.

You channel this familiar into a friendly, willing beast that you hold or touch for the spell's casting time.
This spell can only affect limited selection of animals: horses, ponies, camels, elk, or mastiffs. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) When the spell completes, it fuses this familiar entity with the animal's body.
Your companion keeps the statistics of its form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

A mystic symbiosis forms, amplifying the animal's self-awareness, and gifting the familiar with a new mortal form.
These two entities share the same mind and body.
When your companion drops to 0 hit points, the animal dies, and your familiar drifts to its home plane until you cast this spell again.

Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit.
While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.

While your steed is within 1 mile of you, a telepathic link is active.
Through the link, your steed can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you.

While the link is active, you can issue commands to your steed on your turn, and it obeys your commands loyally.
It takes its turn directly after you on your initiative count.
You can use your bonus action to telepathically command it to move and otherwise act until the beginning of your next turn.
Otherwise, your steed acts on its own, focusing on protecting itself and you.

You can use your action to see through your steed's eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses.
During this time, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by your steed, though you are **blinded**, **deafened**, and **stunned** as your body reels from temporarily shutting down.

Also as an action, you can cause your steed to teleport to any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, or to a safe location that you are both familiar with.

You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.
As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, reverting the effects of this spell.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your steed can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell.
Your steed must be within 1 mile of you, and it must use its action to deliver the spell when you cast it.
If the spell requires an Attack Roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.
