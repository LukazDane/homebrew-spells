## Description
You gain the service of a bound spirit that hails from another plane of existance.
Typically, this spirit come from the Feywild, the Nine Hells, or Elysium.
When you first cast this spell, this immortal entity is mystically selected and bonded to you.

Once your companion spirit is selected, you channel it into an insentient nonmilitary vehicular construct, which must remain within 10 feet of you for the spell's casting duration.
This spell can only affect limited selection of vehicles (at the DM's discretion):
- busses
- cars
- flatbed trucks
- minivans
- motorcycles
- sport utility vehicles

When the spell completes, it fuses your companion spirit with the construct's body.
A mystic symbiosis forms, creating a steed&mdash;granting the construct self-awareness, and gifting the bound spirit with a new mortal form.
The physical characteristics of the vehicular steed reflect its origin to some degree.
For example, a fiendish SUV might be jet black in color, with tinted windows and a sinister-looking front grille.
Your steed keeps the statistics of its construct form and is **charmed** by you.
However, your steed's Intelligence Score increases by `4`, and gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

While your steed is **charmed** by you in this way, you establish a telepathic link with it while you are within 1 mile of one another.
Through the link, you and your steed can telepathically communicate with one another.
Once per round, you can use your action to issue commands to your steed through the link, and it obeys as best as it can.
Otherwise, your steed acts on its own, focusing on protecting itself and you.
Your steed rolls its own initiative.

You can use your action to perceive through your steed's perceptrons and sense what it senses, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses.
During this time, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by your steed, though you are **blinded**, **deafened**, and **stunned** as your body reels from temporarily shutting down.
Also as an action, you can cause your steed to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you.

When you cast a spell with a range of touch, your steed can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell.
Your steed must be within 1 mile of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it.
If the spell requires an Attack Roll or Saving Throw, you use your own spellcasting statistics for the roll.
While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.

You can't have more than one steed or familiar (as from the [*find familiar*](../level-1/find-familiar.md) spell) at a time.
If you cast this spell while you already have a steed or familiar, you can transfer your bound spirit to the new target animal, causing your steed to adopt a new form.
When your steed drops to 0 hit points, the construct is destroyed, and your companion spirit drifts to its home plane until you cast this spell again.
