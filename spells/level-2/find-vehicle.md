## Description
You gain the service of a powerful familiar, a divine spirit that hails from another plane of existance.
It becomes your steed.
Typically, familiars come from the Feywild, the Nine Hells, or Elysium.
When you cast this spell for the very first time, this immortal entity is mystically selected and bonded to you.

You channel this familiar into a nonmilitary land vehicle that is, defacto, owned by you, which you hold or touch for the spell's casting time.
The vehicle has the statistics of a normal vehicle of its sort, though it is celestial, fey, or fiendish (your choice) instead of a construct.
The physical characteristics of the vehicle reflect its origin to some degree.
For example, a fiendish SUV might be jet black in color, with tinted windows and a sinister-looking front grille.
Additionally, if your vehicle has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

A mystic symbiosis forms, granting the vehicle with self-awareness, and gifting the familiar with a new mortal form.
These two entities share the same mind and body.
When your vehicle drops to 0 hit points, it dies, and your familiar drifts to its home plane until you cast this spell again.

You have a supernatural bond with the divine vehicle that allows you to drive beyond your normal ability.
While driving the divine vehicle, you are considered proficient with vehicles of its type, and you add double your proficiency bonus to Ability Checks related to driving the vehicle.
While driving the vehicle, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the vehicle.

While your divine vehicle is within 1 mile of you, a telepathic link is active.
Through the link, your vehicle can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you.

While the link is active, you can issue commands to your vehicle on your turn, and it obeys your commands loyally.
It takes its turn directly after you on your initiative count.
You can use your bonus action to telepathically command it to move and otherwise act until the beginning of your next turn.
Otherwise, your vehicle acts on its own, focusing on protecting itself and you.

You can use your action to sense through your vehicle's sensors, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses.
During this time, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by your vehicle, though you are **blinded**, **deafened**, and **stunned** as your body reels from temporarily shutting down.

You can't have more than one divine vehicle bonded by this spell at a time.
As an action, you can release the vehicle from its bond at any time, reverting the effects of this spell.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell.
Your familiar must be within 1 mile of you, and it must use its action to deliver the spell when you cast it.
If the spell requires an Attack Roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.
