## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
The weapon gleams and glitters with astral starlight.
The first time you hit with an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it unleashes its power upon your target, and the spell ends.
On a hit, the attack deals an extra `2d10` force damage.
The extra damage increases by `1d10` if the target is **invisible** or shapeshifting, and they reveal their true form.
Glittery particles fill the target's space, emitting a dim light in a 10-foot aura until the end of your next turn.
Until then, attacks made against the target within 10 feet of it have advantage, thanks to the risidual arcane energy propelling strikes against it.
During this time, the creature cannot become **invisibile** or use any shapeshifting abilities.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a ranged attack with your weapon and miss.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 2nd.
