## Description
The next time you hit a creature with a Weapon Attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams and glitters with astral radiance as you strike.
The attack deals an extra `2d10` radiant damage to the target, then the spell ends.
If the target is shapeshifting or is **invisible**, you deal an additional `1d10` radiant damage to your target.
Glittery particles fill the target's space, emitting a dim light in a 10-foot aura until the end of your next turn.
Until then, attacks made against the target within 10 feet of it have advantage, thanks to the risidual divine energy propelling strikes against it.
In addition, the target cannot become **invisible** or use shapeshifting abilities until the end of its next short or long rest.

When you make a Weapon Attack during this spell's duration and miss your target, nothing happens unless it was a Ranged Weapon Attack, in which case the spell ends.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 2nd.
