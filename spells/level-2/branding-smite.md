## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It begins to gleam and glimmer with astral starlight, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius.
Until the spell ends, you have advantage on Weapon Attacks using this weapon, and it is considered magical (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before the spell ends, weird symbols cascade upon your target, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `2d10` force damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The extra damage increases by `1d10` if the target is **invisible** or **shapeshifted**, and those effects end.

Glittery particles fill the target's space, emitting a dim light in a 10-foot aura around it until the end of your next turn.
Until then, attacks made against the target within 10 feet of it have advantage, and the target cannot become **invisible** or **shapeshifted**.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the attack increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 2nd.
