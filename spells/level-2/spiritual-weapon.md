## Description
You create a *small* spectral weapon that hovers within range.
The weapon lasts for the duration, or until you cast this spell again.

When you cast the spell, and then later as a bonus action, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and make a Melee Spell Attack against a creature or object within 5 feet of it.
On a hit, the target takes `2d8` force damage.
You can make this attack only once per round.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose.
Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for every slot level above 2nd.
