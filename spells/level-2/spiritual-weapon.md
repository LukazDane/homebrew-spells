## Description
You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again.
When you cast the spell, you can make a Melee Spell Attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon.
On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to `2d4` + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose.
Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St.
Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d4` for every slot level above 2nd.
