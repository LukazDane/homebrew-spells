## Description
You weave together threads of shadow to create a sword of solidified gloom in your free hand.
The blade is semi-corporeal, and can pass through creatures and objects harmlessly at low speeds.
The magic sword is similar in size and shape to a shortsword, and it lasts for the duration.
The blade has the same statistics as a shortsword with the following changes:
- The sword deals `2d8` psychic damage on a hit.
- The sword has the thrown property, with a 20-foot range.
- When you use the sword to attack a target that is in dim light or darkness, you make the attack roll with advantage.

If you drop the weapon or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn.
Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear in your hand.
