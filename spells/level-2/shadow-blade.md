## Description
You weave together threads of shadow to create a semi-corporeal blade of solidified gloom.
The blade wreaths your free hand, and lasts for the duration.
The blade has the same statistics as a *shortsword* with the following properties:
- The shortsword is considered magical.
- The shortsword deals `2d6` necrotic damage on a hit.
- The shortsword deals an extra `2d6` necrotic damage on its first hit.
- The shortsword has the thrown property, with a range of 20 feet.
- You can instantly resummon the shortsword whenever it is used in a Ranged Weapon Attack (no action required).

This spell immediately ends if it is cast again before its duration expires, or if you let go of the shortsword.
The shortsword disappears once the spell ends.
