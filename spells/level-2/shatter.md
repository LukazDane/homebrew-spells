## Description
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes `3d8` thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of a rigid inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

Nonmagical objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried also take the damage if they're in the spell's area. If an object is destroyed in this manner, it shatters into many small pieces.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 2nd.
