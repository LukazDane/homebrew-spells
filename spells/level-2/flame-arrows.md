## Description
You touch a bundle of nine shots of ammunition and imbue them with elemental flame.
They become flaming shots for the duration.
The flaming shots can be contained in a pouch, thong, quiver, or any other mode of storage.
The flaming shots affected must all be the same type, such as bolts or arrows.
You or someone else can take a flaming shot and use it in a Ranged Weapon Attack.
It must be used normally with a weapon that takes the flaming shot's original form as ammunition.
An attack with a flaming shot deals an extra `1d6` fire damage.

The magic on a flaming shot dissipates after it is used in an attack, and reverts to its original form.
The spell ends when there are no more flaming shots affected by its magic, or if you cast it again.
You can dismiss the magic on any number of flaming shots at any time (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of pieces of ammunition you can affect with this spell increases by three for each slot level above 2nd.
