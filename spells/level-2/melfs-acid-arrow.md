You touch an arrow or bolt. A shimmering green energy envelops the item for the duration. When shot, it streaks toward its target and bursts in a spray of acid. On a hit, the target takes `4d4` extra acid damage. Hit or miss, each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the attack's point of impact must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `2d8` acid damage.
