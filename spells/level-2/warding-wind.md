## Description
A strong wind (60 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for the spell's duration.

The wind has the following effects:
- It lightly obscures the area with dust and debris.
- It **deafens** you and all other creatures in its area.
- It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.
- It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.
- Friendly creatures have advantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws when within the warding wind.
- Friendly creatures who target creatures within or past the warding wind with an attack have advantage on their roll.
- Hostile creatures treat the area as difficult terrain.
- Hostile creatures who target creatures within or past the warding wind with an attack have disadvantage on their roll.
- Hostile creatures who move through the wind or end their turn there must make a Strength saving throw. The creature falls **prone** on a failure.
