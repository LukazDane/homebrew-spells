## Description
You craft a batch of healing elixirs.
These elixirs are identical to *healing potions*, however, this spell allows you to craft them more quickly and more efficiently than normal.
When you cast this spell, your DM will determine whether you can use dedicated lab equipment or if you must use makeshift field equipment.

### Lab Crafting
With enough space and dedicated lab equipment worth atleast 5000 sp, this spell becomes very handy.
At the end of this spell's casting, roll an Intelligence Ability Check to determine the quality of your potions, then consult the Lab Crafting Results table listed below.
