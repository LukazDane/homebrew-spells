## Description
Choose a weapon that you can touch.
You imbue the weapon with holy power, and it begins to glow with glorious radiance, eminating sunlight in a 40-foot radius.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
Until the spell ends, the weapon has a `+3` magical bonus to Attack & Damage Rolls.
Additionally, Weapon Attacks made using this weapon deal an extra `2d8` radiant damage on a hit.
The extra damage increases by `1d8` if the target is an undead or fiend.
