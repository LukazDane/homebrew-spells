## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
For the duration, it crackles with interplanar magic.
Until the spell ends, the weapon is considered magical (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before then, it creates a small, volatile, interplanar portal within the target's space, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `6d10` force damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The target must then succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw or be banished.
It has disadvantage on this Saving Throw if this attack reduces the target to 60 hit points or less.

An banished target vanishes, and teleports to another plane of existence.
If the target is native to a different plane than the one you're on, they return to their home plane.
Otherwise, the target randomly teleports to a different plane of existence.
In either case, the target arrives at a location in the plane that is safe enough for them to survive easily.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the attack increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 5th.
