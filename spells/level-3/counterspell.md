## Description
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell.
If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect.
If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, it must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw.
The creature has a bonus to this save equal to the level of the spell that it is casting, minus one plus this spell's level.
On a failed save, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
