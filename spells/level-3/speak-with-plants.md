## Description
You imbue plants in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. 

Until this spell ends, you can question plants in the spell's area about events in their immediate vicinity.
Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the plant retains limited knowledge.
It can give information about creatures that have passed, weather patterns, and other recent events.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration.
Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf (at the DM's discretion).
The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

This spell can cause the plants created by the [*entangle*](../level-1/entangle.md) spell to release a **restrained** creature.
