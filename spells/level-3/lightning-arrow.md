## Description
The next time you make a Ranged Weapon Attack during the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition (or the weapon itself if it's a thrown weapon) transforms into a bolt of lightning.
Make the Attack Roll as normal.
On a hit, the target takes damage from the attack plus `4d8` lightning damage.
The lightning bolt also forms a 5-foot-wide line that extends out from you to the target of your attack.
Each creature in the line excluding you must make a Dexterity Saving Throw, taking `4d6` lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.

The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.
