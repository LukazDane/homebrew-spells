## Description
You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with unknown horrors.
A 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold appears, centered on a point within range and lasting for the duration.
No light (magical or otherwise) can illuminate the area, and its area is heavily obscured.
Creatures fully within the area are **blinded** and can't take reactions.
This void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers and slurping noises that can be heard up to 500 feet away.

The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the area is difficult terrain.
Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes `2d6` cold damage.
Any creature who moves through the area for the first time on its turn must make a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `2d6` necrotic damage as milky, otherworldy tentacles hurtle toward it.
Any creature that ends its turn in the area takes `2d6` acid damage as the thick air seems to devour and digest its essence.
