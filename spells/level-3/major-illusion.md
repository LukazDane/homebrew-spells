## Description
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 30-foot-long cube.
The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration.
You have full control over the image's animation within its space.
It seems completely real to every sensation, and includes sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted.
You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).

You can cause the image to move to any spot within range at any time (no action required).
As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.
For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
You can also adjust the percieved physics of the image, such as how wind, light, and gravity interacts with it.
Detailed arrangements&mdash;like flowing cloaks, water, and hair&mdash;are intuitively taken care of through your magic.

Likewise, detailed yet subtle scents, sounds, and feelings accompany this spell automatically.
Even a certain degree of physical touch holds up to scrutiny.
For example, if you create an illusion of a creature that talks, its lips move and body gesticulates in a believable fashion.
If you create a gushing fountain of water, the cold spittle and wet puddles can be felt by creatures as they enter the illusion's area.
If you cover a foe's equipment in slime, it will be smelly and sticky to them, even as they attempt to wipe the slop off their body.

If the illusion is of a moving creature or object, it has an AC of `9 + your Spellcasting Ability Modifier`.
Attacks and other forms of sudden physical collision with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
A creature that uses its action to explicitly examine or interact with the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence Saving Throw.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

<!--
Tip: a player always knows somethings up if they are asked make a saving throw.
Especially if it is a weird one, like Intelligence.
In these cases, players can guess that they are making a check for an illusion&mdash;whether or not they pass.
That means the cat is out of the bag for an illusion.
The jig is up!

Half the fun in illusions is that the players don't know when an illusion exists.
So, try to frame it a bit differently for illusions.
Ask for an intelligence check, but give them proficiency if you know they are proficient in intelligence saving throws.
If you aren't sure which players have this proficiency without asking, check their class.
Classes with proficiency in Intelligence Saving Throws include:
- Artificers
- Druids
- Mystics
- Rogues
- Wizards
