## Description
Choose an object or point within range.
If you choose an object, it must be no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.
Until the spell ends, the source you chose sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius. The light can be colored as you like.
Completely covering the source with something opaque blocks the light.
The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

When you first cast this spell or as an action, you can end the spell by expelling its remaining energy, causing the source you chose to flare with blinding light.
Each creature within the sphere of bright light created by this spell must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or become **blinded** for 5 minutes.
A creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
