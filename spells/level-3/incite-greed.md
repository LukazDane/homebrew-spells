## Description
When you cast this spell, you hurl the gem used as the material component to any spot within range.
Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the coin must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **charmed** by you for the duration.

While **charmed** in this way, a creature can do nothing but use its movement and action to make a Wisdom Ability Check and greedily search for the gem.
The difficulty of this check is equal to `your Spell Save DC + 10`.

An affected creature can repeat its Saving Throw if it is ever attacked, targeted by a spell, or damaged.
Otherwise the spell lasts for the duration, or until gem is found.
