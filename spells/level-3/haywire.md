## Description
This spell plays havoc with electronic devices, making the use of such devices all but impossible.
Select one digital or mechanical device within range.
It is subject to random behavior for the duration.
If the device is held by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or have the device affected by the spell.

At the start of each of your turns, roll a `d6` for each affected device to determine its behavior.
Except where otherwise indicated, that behavior lasts until the start of your next turn while this spell is in effect.

### Detrimental Behavior
| `d6`      | Effect                                                                                                |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | The device shuts down and must be restarted.
Do not roll again for this device until it is restarted. |
| 2&mdash;4 | The device does not function.                                                                         |
| 5         | The device experiences a power surge, causing an electric shock to each creature within 5 feet of the device.
Each affected creature must make a Dexterity Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC, taking `6d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 6         | The device is usable as normal.                                                                       |

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the sphere affected by the spell increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
