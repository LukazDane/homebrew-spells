## Description
You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration.
Using your movement, you step into a stone you can touch.
Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses, unless you choose to reveal yourself as an rudementry, animated drawing of yourself.

While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom Ability Checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage.
You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone.
You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell.
You otherwise can't move.

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals `3d12` bludgeoning damage to you.
The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals `3d48` bludgeoning damage to you.
If expelled, you fall **prone** in an unoccupied space closest to the point where you first entered.
