## Description
An area of elemental storm appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 120 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see.

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning in the shape of a cylinder that is 120 feet tall with a 5-foot radius flashes down to that point. Each creature within the bolt's area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes this spell's lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

The amount of damage that your lightning bolts deal depends on your surroundings. When you cast this spell, choose the most powerful option available to you as listed from below.

### Command Storm
This option can only be chosen if weather conditions are right. There must be a severe storm cloud in your immediate area, producing heavy precipitation and thunder, like a storm created by [*summon storm*](../level-3/summon-storm.md). The cylinder of storm that you chose must also fit with no large obstructions blocking it, such as narrow walls or low ceilings.

If conditions are right, you seize the storm. An ominous force of elemental energy fills the cylinder of storm that you chose. For the duration, the scent of ozone fills the air; winds and clouds swirl unnaturally in the area. This spell deals `4d10` lightning damage from lightning called from this elemental force.

### Fabricate Storm
This option can be chosen if the cylinder of storm you chose fits with no large obstructions blocking it, such as narrow walls or low ceilings.

A spiraling storm of dark clouds swirls into existance at the top of the cylinder of storm you chose. This spell deals `3d10` lightning damage from lightning called from this elemental force.

### Aura of Static
If there is not enough room to accommodate the cylinder of storm, it fills as much of the area as it can with ambient static energy, which spreads around corners.

This spell deals `2d10` lightning damage from lightning called from this elemental force.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 3rd.
