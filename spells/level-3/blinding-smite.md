## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
For the duration, it sings a holy hymn in any language (at the DM's discretion) and radiates divine power, pouring out bright light in a 40-foot radius.
Until the spell ends, the weapon is considered magical (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before then, it thrusts its fervent essence upon your target, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `1d60` radiant damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The target must then succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or become **blinded** and **deafened**.
At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Constitution Saving throw, ending both effects on itself on a success.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the extra damage increases by `1d60`.
When you cast this spell using a 9th level spell slot, the extra damage increases by `2d60` instead.
