## Description
The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra `1d48` radiant damage to the target.
Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be **blinded**.
A creature **blinded** by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a successful save, it is no longer **blinded**.

When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and miss your target, nothing happens unless it was a ranged weapon attack, in which case the spell ends.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again (no action required).
