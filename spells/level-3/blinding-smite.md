## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
The weapon releases a righteous light for the duration, as if [*light*](../cantrips/light.md) was cast on it, and eminates a holy hymn that is sung in any language (at the DM's discretion).
The first time you hit with an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it thrusts its fervent essence upon your target, and the spell ends.
On a hit, the attack deals an extra `1d60` radiant damage.
Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or be **blinded**.
A creature **blinded** by this spell makes another Constitution Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a successful save, it is no longer **blinded**.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a ranged attack with your weapon and miss.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
