## Description
You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range.
Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `1d8` necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack.
Also, the target gains one semi-permanent level of **exhaustion** that is removed only when the spell ends.
When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:
- While cursed, the target is vulnerable to one of the following damage types of your choice: acid, fire, cold, lightning, thunder, poison, or psychic.
- While cursed, the target must make a Charisma Saving Throw at the start of each of its turns.
	If it fails, it becomes **stunned** until the beginning of its next turn.
- While cursed, the target cannot deal a critical hit.
- While cursed, the target is blinded.
- While cursed, the target is deafened.
- While cursed, the target cannot speak.

At the DM's discretion, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.
The DM has final say on such a curse's effect.

The spell can be ended early if you dismiss it (no action required) or if a [*remove curse*](../level-3/remove-curse.md) or [*dispel magic*](../level-3/dispel-magic.md) spell successfully ends its effect.
