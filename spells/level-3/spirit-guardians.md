## Description
You call forth spirits to protect you.
They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration.
Their spectral forms may appear angelic, bestial, fey, or fiendish (depending on your alignment).

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures to be unaffected by it.
When the guardians first appear, each affected creature in the aura must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
A target takes `3d8` radiant, force, or necrotic damage (depending on your alignment) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A target must repeat this Saving Throw when it moves through the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

Any affected creature in the aura must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 3rd.
