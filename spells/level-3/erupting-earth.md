## Description
Choose a point you can see on the ground within range.
A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 15-foot-radius cylinder that is 60-feet tall centered on that point.
Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d12` bludgeoning damage and falls **prone** on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one and doesn't fall **prone**.
Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d12` for each slot level above 3rd.
