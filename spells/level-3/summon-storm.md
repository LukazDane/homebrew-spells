## Description
Until the spell ends, dark swirling clouds appear overhead, centered on a point you choose within range.
The clouds form 120 feet above the ground, and have a 60-foot radius.

Precipitation violently plummets from the clouds at once.
The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area when you first cast it, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your Spell Save DC or lose concentration.
You do not need to make this initial save.

Then, you can choose the type of precipitation, which each have varying effects.

### Downpour
Heavy rain and wind fills the area.
This choice requires no concentration.
You can end this spell at any time (no action required).

### Freezing Sleet
The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain.
When a creature moves through the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, it falls **prone**.

### Hailstorm
A creature who moves through the hailstorm or starts its turn there must make a Strength saving throw.
On a failed save, it takes `2d6` bludgeoning or cold damage (whichever does more).
