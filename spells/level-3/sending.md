## Description
You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar.
You can speak to it as if you shared a common language.
The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately.
The spell enables creatures of any intelligence to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a `5%` chance that the message doesn't arrive.
