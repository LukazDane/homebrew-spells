Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends.
For each spell 4th level or higher, the target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw.
The target has a bonus to this save equal to the level of the spell that it is casting, minus this spell's level plus one.
On a failed save, the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.
