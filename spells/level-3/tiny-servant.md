## Description
You touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that isn't attached to another object or a surface and isn't being carried by another creature. The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points. The servant has the statistics as shown on the Tiny Servent Statistics table outlined at the end of this spell's description.

When you cast the spell, you can mentally command the servant to interact with the environment around it. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) The servant can perform simple tasks, such as fetching things, standing watch, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give a command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability. If a given task would take longer than one round to complete, it takes on an autonomous locomotion on each of your turns until its task is complete. The servant waits for your next command once it finishes a task. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. As an action, you can command the servant once again for further service. The servant can move up to 30 feet each time you command it.

When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.
