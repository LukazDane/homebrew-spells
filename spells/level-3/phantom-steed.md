## Description
A *large* quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range.
You decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle, which cannot be removed from the creature's quasi-real form.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed.
The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse.
When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount.
The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.
