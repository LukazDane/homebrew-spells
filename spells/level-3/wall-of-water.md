## Description
You can either command 9000 gallons of water or create as much salt water on the ground at a point you can see within range.
It magically floats upwards as you cast this spell and create a wall.
You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick.
The dissipates when the spell ends, and the water pours outwards from it.
The wall's space is heavily obscured, and is difficult terrain.
It has the following affects:
- Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack roll. 
- Fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target.
- Any lightning damage is blocked by the wall of water, but the effects course through this spell's area.
	- If the incoming spell would targeted one creature or target, it instead becomes an area of effect spell with an area matching the wall's area.
	- If the incoming spell was already an area of effect, that effect extends throughout the water.
Creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw against the spell or take the spell's effects.
- Any cold damage is blocked by the wall of water, and causes any affected area of the water to freeze solid in 5Ã—5-foot chunks.
	- Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. 
	- Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. 
	- When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.
