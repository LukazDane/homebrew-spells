## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It becomes hot with electric energy until the end of your next turn.
Until the spell ends, the weapon is considered magical (if it isn't already).
The first time you make an attack with this weapon before then, it delivers a powerful shock your target, and the spell ends.
The target gains no benefit from cover for this attack.
If the attack hits, it deals an extra `3d8` lightning damage to the target in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.

Hit or miss, if the attack you made was a Ranged Weapon Attack, then the weapon's ammunition&mdash;or the ammunition if it's a ranged weapon&mdash;transforms into a bolt of lightning.
The lightning forms a 5-foot-wide line that extends out from you to the target of your attack.
Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d8` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
If the attack hits your target, then it automatically fails this save.
The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 3rd.
