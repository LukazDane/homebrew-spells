## Description
You create a 20-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range.
Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

Until the spell ends, the circle is protected against one or more of the following types of creatures of your choice: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The magic circle grants several benefits.
When a creature of the chosen type targets any number of creatures within the spell's area with an attack, spell, or ability, they must flip `a coin`.
On a `tails`, those creatures within the circle are not affected by the action.
In addition, creatures within the circle can't be **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by creatures of the chosen type.
Creatures within the circle have advantage on any new Saving Throw against such affects if they are already **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by such a creature.

Creatures of the chosen type also can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means.
If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel while in the circle, it must first succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw.

When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.
