## Description
You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees).
The sensor remains fixed in place for the duration, and it can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.

When you cast the spell, you choose seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling.
You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space.
As your action, you can switch between senses.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from [*see invisibility*](./see-invisibility) or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.
