## Description
You reach into the mind of one creature you can see and force it to make a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **frightened** by every creature it can see for the duration.
While the target is **frightened** in this way, it loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the spell ends.

The **frightened** creature must begin each of its turns by using an action to attack or cast a spell against the closest and largest batch of enemies, using its best resources to fight and otherwise survive (at the DM's discretion).
If the is not in range to attack or cast a spell, it must use its action to take the *dash* action and move away from its percieved enemies by the safest availabe route on its turn, unless it has nowhere to move.
The target cannot use bonus actions while **frightened** in this way, and must use its reaction to attack if it ever has the opportunity.

The **frightened** creature can move as normal on its turn.
If there are multiple sources of fear restricting its movement, it can move towards a source of fear if it is moving away from at least two others.

If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to another creature, the creature can make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a successful save, the spell ends.
