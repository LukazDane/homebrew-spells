## Description
You call forth spirits of nature to soothe the wounded.
They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration.
Their spectral form may appear beastial, angelic, fey, or fiendish (depending on your alignment).

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be affected by it.
When an affected creature takes 5 or more damage while in the area, the spirits restore `1d6` hit points to that creature (no action required).
The spirits cannot heal constructs or undead.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing becomes more effective.
For every 5 additional points of damage that an affected creature takes, the spirits can restore `1d6` extra hit points. 

However, the number of extra healing dice cannot exceed the number of extra slot levels used for this casting.
For example, if this spell is cast at 3rd level, then a spirit can only heal up to `2d6` hit points&mdash;even if an affected creature takes more than 15 points of damage.
