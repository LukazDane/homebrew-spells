## Description
You call forth spirits to soothe the wounded.
They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration.
Their spectral forms may appear angelic, bestial, fey, or fiendish (depending on your alignment).

The spirits share a pool of healing power.
With that pool, they can restore up to a total of `30` hit points.
At the start of a creature's turn, the spirits can draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to any creature within the spell's area (no action required), up to the maximum amount remaining in their pool.
The spirits canâ€™t heal constructs or undead.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spirits start with `10` additional points in their pool of healing power.
