**Casting Time:** action

**Duration:** instantaneous

**Range:** touch

**Tags:** verbal, somatic

## Description
Choose one creature, object, or magical effect that you can touch.
Then, choose one curse that you know is affecting the target.
If the chosen curse is of 3rd level or lower, you remove the curse and the spell ends.
Otherwise, you must succeed on an Wisdom Saving Throw against the chosen curse's Spell Save DC (determined by its original curse layer) plus its level.
You have a bonus on this Saving Throw equal to this spell's level (normally three).
On a success, you destroy the magic and the chosen curse is lifted.
If you fail this save by 10 or more, the curse spreads to you as well.

If the target is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
In this case, the DM adjucates the approximate spell level used to curse the item.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can lift a curse with no Saving Throw if the disrupted curse's level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
Otherwise, your bonus to the Intelligence Saving Throw increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.
