## Description
You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot-long cube within range.
Each target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.
- Their movement speed is halved.
- Their attacks have disadvantage.
- They get a `â€“2` penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws.
- They have disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- They cannot use their bonus action.
	If they have multiple bonus actions to use, they can use one less.
- They cannot use their reaction.
	If they have multiple reactions to use, they can use one less.
- If they use their action to take the attack action, then they can make one less attack as a part of that action (minimum of one).
- If they use their action to take the cast a spell action, then they must flip `a coin`.
	On a `tails`, the spell fails.

A creature can use its action to make a Charisma saving throw and try to end this spell's effect on it.
On a success, the effect ends for it.
When the spell ends, an affected creature gets an additional action on its next turn, as a jolt of vigor overwhelms it.

> If you exploit this spell by purposefully casting it on allies and immediately ending the spell, you are declared a munchkin and Mystra bans you from casting this spell ever again within this multiverse.
