## Description
A huge, swirling storm of freezing gales (80 mph) and icy debris explodes into existence, centered on you.
The storm takes the shape of a 90-foot-radius cylinder that is 30 feet tall.
This storm has the following properties:
- It magically reduces the air temperature in the area by 5 degrees fahrenheit per round until the spell ends.
- It magically generates snow and hail, blanketing the surrounding area with the element of winter.
- It heavily obscures the area with blistering wind, snow, and icy debris.
- It makes you and all other creatures in its area **blinded** and **deafened**.
- It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area.
- It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.
- Its area is difficult terrain.
- Any creature within the storm has disadvantage on all attacks and Ability Checks.
- Any creature that attacks something within or past the blizzard has disadvantage on its Attack Roll.
- Any creature that moves through the blizzard or ends its turn there must make a Strength Saving Throw.
	On a failure, the creature takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage, `2d6` cold damage, and falls prone.
	On a success, the creature takes half damage and doesnâ€™t fall prone.

There are relatively few ways to end this spell early.
One such way is using magic, such as [*dispel magic*](../level-3/dispel-magic.md), to force the spell eto end.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, both the bludgeoning and cold damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 4th.
