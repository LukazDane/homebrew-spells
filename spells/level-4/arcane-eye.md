## Description
You create an invisible sensor within range that hovers in the air for the duration.

You mentally receive information from the sensor.
The amplified aspects of this sensor allow you to see all around it, smell subtle scents nearby, hear the slightest sounds, and even taste and feel objects close to the sensor if you choose to do so.
You can otherwise sense through the sensor as if you were in its space.

As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction.
There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can't enter another plane of existence.
A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can squeeze through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous orb about the size of your fist.
The orb has intricate designs on it akin to an eyeball.
