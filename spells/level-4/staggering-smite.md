## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
The weapon harbors a dark, destructive energy for the duration.
The first time you hit with an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it pierces the mind, body, and spirit.
On a hit, the attack deals `5d12` force, psychic, or necrotic damage (your choice).
The target must then succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw or become **stunned** until the end of your next turn.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with your weapon and miss.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
