## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
For the duration, it harbors dark and terrible energies, ill spoken by mortalkind.
Until the spell ends, the weapon is considered magical (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before then, it inflicts the mind body and spirit with insufferable pain, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `25` force, necrotic, or psychic damage (your choice) in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The target must then succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or become **stunned** until the end of your next turn.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
