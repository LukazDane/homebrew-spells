## Description
Your very touch rends the mortal spirit. Make a melee spell attack against a target creature that you try to touch. You have disadvantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal, or is itself made of metal. On a hit, the target takes `1d10` necrotic damage, and a tenebrous afterimage of your hand continues to cling to the target even as you let go. It remains there until the end of your next turn. Until then, the target can't regain hit points.

If the target you hit is Large or smaller, it also has disadvantage on all attack rolls made against you until the end of your next turn. A creature who is resistant to necrotic damage ignores secondary effects caused by this spell.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level.
