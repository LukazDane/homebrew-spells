You can also combine the six lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move each of the lights up to a distance of 120 feet. A light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
