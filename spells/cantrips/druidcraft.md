## Description
Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:
- You create a tiny natural effect, such as a showering of snowflakes, a puff of cloud, a golden orb of sunlight, and so on.
- Your magic inspires the wildlife around you, such that you can instantly make flowers blossom, cause seed pods to open, spawn a troop of mushrooms, or amplify natural fragrances.
- You produce a minor effect in the environment, such as falling leaves from trees, breezes from the wind, or a chattering among small animals nearby.
- You have a subdued power over the elements. For example, you can instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- You can 'read' the thoughts and feelings of simple plants. They tend hyperfocus on their current state of being.
- You use these harmless sensory effects to predict what the weather will be at your location in the near future.

The environment you effect returns to its natural order briefly after casting this spell.

> *Druidcraft* is a powerful roleplaying tool in that the spell's scope is not so limited by its description, but instead your imagination.
