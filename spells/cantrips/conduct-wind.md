## Description
You seize an area of wind, which must fit within a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range.
You can command the air to create one of the following effects:
- You focus this spell on a creature within the spell's area, weaponizing the wind around it as you desire.
	The target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or take `1d4` bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice).
- You focus this spell on a creature within the spell's area, attempting to blow them aside with a strong gust.
	The target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or be pushed 10 feet in a direction of your choice.
	The target must be *medium* or smaller, otherwise it automatically succeeds on this Saving Throw.
- You create some harmless sensory effect using the airâ€”causing airy flourishes in your clothes, blasting doors open, or rustling foliage in the area.
	This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
