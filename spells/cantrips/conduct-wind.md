## Description
You seize control of an area of air, which must fit within a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range. You can guide the wind in one of the following ways:
- You focus this spell on a creature or object that you can see within the spell's area, weaponizing the wind around it as you desire. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take `1d4` bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice).
- You focus this spell on a creature or object that you can see within the spell's area, attempting to blow them aside with a strong gust. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice. The target must be *medium* or smaller, otherwise it automatically succeeds on this saving throw.
- You create some harmless sensory effect using the air. The effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
	- Leaves and foliage rustle with an airy breeze.
	- Your hair and clothing ripple in a gentle breath of wind.
	- Open doors and shutters slam shut with howling gale.
