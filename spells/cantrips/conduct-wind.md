## Description
You seize the air and compel it to create one of the following effects at a point you can see within range:
- A concentrated burst of wind homes at a creature that you choose within range. It must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target will take `1d4` piercing damage.
- One Medium or smaller creature that you choose within range must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the ceature is pushed up to be 10 feet in a direction of your choice and is knocked prone.
- One Medium or smaller object that you choose within range is pushed up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. If that object is held by a creature, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, the creature holds on to the object.
- Your hair and clothing ripples in a gentle breath of wind.
- Open doors and shutters slam shut with howling flurries of wind.
- Leaves or foliage rustles with an airy breeze.
