## Description
You create an illusion within a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range.
The spell lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it (no action required).
The illusion vanishes if it exceeds the spell's range from you or if you cast this spell again.

When you cast this spell, choose one faculty of sensation: sight, sound, or smell.
Your illusion immitates this (and only this) sensation.

Regardless of your choice, physical interaction with the illusion's space reveals it to be a trick of the mind, because the magic weirdly distorts and fades for a moment.
Additionally, a creature that uses its action to examine the illusion from afar can determine its true nature with a successful Intelligence Saving Throw.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, it becomes faint to them.

### Sight
You create an illusory image.
The image forms from within the spell's area, and remains there for the duration.
It can take the shape of a chair, muddy footprints, a small chest, or any other object of your choice.
However, the image does not have to replicate an ordinary object; it can appear to be as abstract, strange, or grostesque as you desire.
The illusion can't create light, reflection, sound, smell, or any other sensory effect.

### Sound
You create the illusion of a sound.
The sound originates from within the spell's area.
Its volume can range from a whisper to a scream.
It can replicate your voice, someone else's voice, a roaring lion, a beating of drums, or any other sound of your choice.
However, the sound must also be short and simple; it repeats every round on-loop throughout the spell's duration, although it can do so with slight variations to help suspend disbelief.

### Smell
You create an imitation of a scent.
The scent generates from within the spell's area for the duration, and it slowly wafts outwards from there.
Its intensity can range from a hint of perfume to the pungent tang of a sewer.
You decide what flavors the illusion evokes.
