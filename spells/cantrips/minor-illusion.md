## Description
You create a small illusion within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it (no action required) or cast this spell again. 

If a creature uses its action to examine the illusion, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

When you cast this spell, choose one faculty of sensation: sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch. Your illusion immitates this (and only this) faculty.

### Sight
If you create an image, it can take the form of an object&mdash;such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest&mdash;or any shape that you desire, but it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube.

When you cast this spell, you can animate this image with a disjointed farce of motion&mdash;so long as it remains within its original 5-foot cube. The animation lasts until the end of your next turn, and can change in any way you might like until then. As an action on your turn, you can animate the image once again.

The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

### Sound
If you create a sound, it originates at full volume from within a 5-foot cube. Its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other simple, repetetive sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the spell's duration.

When you cast this spell, you can add an intricate dynamic to this sound effect, such as music or coherent speech. You can also make discrete sounds at different times. The dynamic lasts until the end of your next turn, and can change in any way you might like until then. As an action on your turn, you can manipulate the dynamic of the sound like this once again.

### Smell
If you create a scent, you pick its odor and intensity. It generates from within a 5-foot cube for the duration, and slowly wafts outwards from there.

When you cast this spell, you can shift the nature of the smell however you see fit until the end of your next turn. For example, you might make the scent begin overwhelming, and slowly scale down its intensity. As an action on your turn, you can shift its nature once again.

The smell disappears completely when the spell ends.

### Taste
If you create a flavor, it effects all items within a 5-foot cube for the duration. Each affected item shares the same flavor, and retains the flavor even if it is removed from the cube.

When you cast this spell, you can adjust this flavor however you see fit until the end of your next turn. For example, you might make an item begin sweet and become terribly spicy with its aftertaste. As an action on your turn, you can adjust the flavor once again.

### Touch
If you create a texture, it effects surfaces within a 5-foot cube for the duration. Each affected item shares the same texture, and retains the texture even if it is removed from the cube.

When you cast this spell, you can adjust this texture however you see fit until the end of your next turn. For example, you might make a surface of metal seem scalding hot - although the creature can't take damage from this spell. As an action on your turn, you can adjust the texture once again.
