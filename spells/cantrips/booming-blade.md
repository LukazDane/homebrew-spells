## Description
Touch a weapon of your choice. The weapon is sheathed in orange, gleaming energy until the end of your next turn. The first time a creature makes a melee weapon attack with this weapon before then, it unleashes its energy upon its target, and the spell ends. If the attack hits, the target takes `1d4` thunder damage and suffers the attack's normal effects. In addition, it becomes entrapped in a net of booming energy until the end of your next turn. If the target moves before then (willingly or unwillingly), it immediately takes `2d4` thunder damage.

If you let go of the weapon, its curse dissipates, and the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, both the initial melee attack and the damage the target takes for moving deals an extra `1d4` thunder damage for each slot level.
