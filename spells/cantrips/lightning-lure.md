## Description
You wrangle a semi-physical lash out of pure lightning energy.
The lash of lightning forms in your free hand, and lasts for the duration.
The lash has the same statistics as an ordinary *whip* with the following properties:
- The whip sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
- The whip is considered magical.
- The whip deals `1d4` lightning damage on a hit.
- If you hit a creature that is within 5 feet of you with a Melee Weapon Attack using this whip, then it deals an extra `1d4` lightning damage.

This spell immediately ends if it is cast again before its duration expires, or if you let go of the whip.
The whip disappears once the spell ends.
