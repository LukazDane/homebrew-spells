## Description
You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to swarm upon one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes `1d6` poison damage, and the target can't take the **dash** action or any reactions until the end of your next turn, when the insects disperse. For each point of damage that the target takes from this spell, it moves 5 feet in a random cardinal direction. The target can't move a distance greater than its movement speed from this effect.
