## Description
You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range.
You create one of the following magical effects within range:
- Your voice temporarily booms up to three times as loud as normal, or the appearance of your eyes is strangely altered.
- You affect small objects around you, causing unlocked containers, doors, and windows to fly open and slam shut.
	Unsecured items near you might fling around aimlessly.
- You call upon a sound and supernatural forces reciprocate, producing rumbles of thunder, cries of a raven, ominous whispers, light footsteps and more.
- You cause strange, minor anomolies in the laws of physics&mdash;briefly affecting gravity, time, space, and other phenomena.
- You have a subdued power over the elements.
	For example, you can conjure a tuft of flame, cause harmless tremors in the ground, or attain a freezing touch.
- You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color.

These effects are normally quite brief, but can last longer (at the DM's discretion), depending on the nature of the spell's specific casting.

> *Thaumaturgy* is a powerful roleplaying tool in that the spell's scope is not limited by its description, but instead your imagination.
