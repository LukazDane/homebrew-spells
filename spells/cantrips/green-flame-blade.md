## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding. The weapon is shrouded in green, flaming energy until the end of your next turn. The first time a creature makes a melee weapon attack with this weapon before then, it unleashes its energy upon its target, and the spell ends. If the attack hits, the target takes `1d10` fire damage and suffers the attack's normal effects.

If you let go of the weapon, its curse dissipates, and the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level.
