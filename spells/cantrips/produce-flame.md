## Description
A flickering flame appears in one of your hands, and you hurl the flame at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `1d10` fire damage.

You can also hold onto the flame instead of attacking with it immediately. When you do so, the flame lingers harmlessly in your hand for up to 1 day, and sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius. You can use a bonus action to hurl the flame on a later turn, although doing so ends the spell. Likewise, you can end the spell if you choose to dismiss it (no action required).

If you have two or more hands, you can maintain an instance of this spell in each of your hands.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level.
