## Description
You create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to a mile away. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius aura, including you, must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `1d12` thunder damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you by the spell's effect. If *you* fail the save, you can choose which direction that you are pushed.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by `1d12` for each slot level.
