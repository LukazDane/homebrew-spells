## Description
You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:
- You pummel one creature with the earth. It must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `1d4` bludgeoning damage.
- You trip one Medium or smaller creature with the earth. That creature must make a Strength saving throw, or be thrown prone.
- If the dirt or stone you target is a part of the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain.
- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 30 feet away.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
