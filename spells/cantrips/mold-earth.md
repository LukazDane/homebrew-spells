## Description
You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:
- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 30 feet away.
- You can try to grab one Medium or smaller creature with the earth, and pull them into it&mdash;provided they are standing on solid earth. That creature must make a Stregth saving throw, or become restrained. The creature can repeat this save at the end of each of its turns in attempts to escape.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns.
- If the dirt or stone you target is a part of the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
