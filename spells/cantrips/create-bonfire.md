## Description
You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature moves through the bonfire's space or ends its turn there must succeed on a Dexterity save or take `1d6` fire damage.

Once per turn, you can flare up the bonfire as a bonus action, causing extra damage to creatures within the flames. Those creatures must make the saving throw against the bonfire's damage.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level.
