## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding. The weapon is sheathed in purple, gleaming energy until the end of your next turn. The first time you make a melee weapon attack with this weapon before then, it unleashes its booming energy upon its target, and the spell ends. If the attack hits, the target takes `1d4` thunder damage and suffers the attack's normal effects. In addition, it becomes entrapped in a net of booming energy until the end of your next turn. If the target moves before then (willingly or unwillingly), it immediately takes `2d4` thunder damage.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.
