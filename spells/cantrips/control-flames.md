## Description
You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range. You affect it in one of the following ways:
- If the flame is Small or larger, you can make it blast out a single creature within 5 feet of it. The target creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take `1d10` fire damage.
- You intensify the flames, making it spread and expend its fuel more quickly. The amount of light it gives out doubles.
- You subdue the flames, making it spread and expend its fuel more slowly. The amount of light it gives out halves.
- You change the flame's color.
- You cause simple shapes&mdash;such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location&mdash;to appear within the flames and animate as you like until the end of your next turn.
