## Description
You stir a region of fire, which must fit within a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range.
You can compel the flames to create one of the following effects:
- You focus this spell on a creature within 10 feet of the spell's area, discharging the blaze out toward it.
	The target must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `1d10` fire damage.
	The flame in the area then extinguishes.
- You intensify the flames:
	- It expends its fuel more quickly.
	- It gives off twice the amount of light.
	- It spreads more quickly.
	- It extinguishes if its fuel runs out.
- You subdue the flames:
	- It expends its fuel more slowly.
	- It gives off half the amount of light.
	- It spreads more slowly.
	- It extinguishes if you command it to.
- You change the flame's color.
- You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames.
	This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
