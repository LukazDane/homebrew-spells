## Description
When you cast this spell, you can choose to immediately hurl the acid, or to store it for later use.

### Hurl Acid
You hurl a bubble of acid at a point you choose within range, which then splatters on impact. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `1d6` acid damage.

### Store Acid
You fill a *glass bottle* or similar container that you touch with acid, yielding one 16-ounce *vial of acid*. This item deals `1d6` acid damage instead of its normal damage amount.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the acid damage for either choice increases by `1d6` for each slot level.
