## Description
You create a long, vine-like whip covered in thorns that lashes out at your command. The whip forms in your free hand, and lasts for the duration. The whip has the same statistics as a regular whip with the following changes:
- The whip has a reach of 15 feet.
- The whip deals `1d4` magical slashing damage on a hit.
- If you hit a creature that is Large or smaller with this whip, you can pull it up to 15 feet closer to you.

If you let go of the whip or cast this spell again, it disappears, and the spell ends.
