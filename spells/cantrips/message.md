## Description
You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) can understand the message. Until the end of your next turn, it can reply in a whisper that only you can understand (no action required). Regardless of a whisper's volume, both parties involved hear it clearly and comfortably.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or magical silence blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line to its target and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
