## Description
You rouse a volume of water, which must fit within a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range.
You can direct the water to create one of the following effects:
- You focus this spell on a creature within 30 feet of the spell's area, lashing a gout of water out at your target.
	It must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `1d8` bludgeoning damage.
- You focus this spell on a creature within the spell's area, sucking the heat out from your target.
	It must succeed on a Constituton Saving Throw or take `1d8` cold damage.
- You move the water, depositing it up to 30 feet away in any direction.
- You change the flow of the water as you direct, and can continue to do so until the end of your next turn (no action required).
- You can cause the water's phase to transform into mist or ice, or vice versa.
- You change the color or opacity of the water within the cube.
- You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the water.
	This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
