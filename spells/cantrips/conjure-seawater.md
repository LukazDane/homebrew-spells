## Description
You conjure up to 100 gallons of liquid saltwater inside a 5-foot-long cube originating from on a point on the ground that you can see within range. The water spills and pours from the cube unless there is something to contain it. Any *small* or smaller creature in the saltwater's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall **prone**. Any water or air that enters the cube's space is slowly becomes cold and salty.

Once per round, you can cause the cube to spout 100 more gallons of saltwater as a bonus action, engulfing creatures within the water's area. Those creatures must make the saving throw against the water's forceful effects.

## At Higher Levels
