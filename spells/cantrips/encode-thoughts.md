## Description
Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind.
You make a copy of the thought, transforming it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again.
The thought strand appears in your hand as a *tiny*, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon.

If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read the thoughts of others (such as [*detect thoughts*][detect thoughts]), you can copy the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.

Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains.
Casting [*detect thoughts*][detect thoughts] on the strand has the same effect.
