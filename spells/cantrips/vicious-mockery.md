## Description
You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it takes `1d4` psychic damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn.
