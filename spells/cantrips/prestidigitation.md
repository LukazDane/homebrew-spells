## Description
This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
- You create a tiny sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
- You chill, heat, soil, clean, color, or flavor up to 1-cubic foot of material.
- You materialize small mark or symbol onto an object or a surface.
- You transform the shape of one simple, nonmagical trinket that can fit in your hand into another.
- You have a subdued power over the elements. For example, you can instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- You magically open or close an unlocked door or container within range.

> Prestidigitation is a powerful roleplaying tool in that the spell's scope is not limited by its description, but instead your imagination.
