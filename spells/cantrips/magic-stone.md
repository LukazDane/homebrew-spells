## Description
You touch up to three stones and imbue them with magic. A stone's magic lasts for the duration. You or someone else can take a stone and use it in a ranged weapon attack. If thrown, a stone acts as an improvised weapon. If used as ammunition, it can be used in a sling or a similar weapon that hurls stones. In either case, an attack with a magic stone has the following additional properties:
- A magic stone deals magical bludgeoning damage.
- Attacks with a magic stone have a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your spellcasting ability modifier (rounded up).

The magic on a stone dissipates after it is used in an attack. The spell ends if

If you cast this spell again, the spell ends on any pebbles still affected by your previous casting.
