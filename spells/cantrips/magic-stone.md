## Description
You touch three stones and imbue them with magic. A stone's magic lasts for the duration. You or someone else can take a stone and use it in a ranged weapon attack. If thrown, a stone acts as an improvised weapon. If used as ammunition, it can be used normally in a sling or a similar weapon that hurls stones. In either case, an attack with a magic stone has the following properties:
- A magic stone deals magical bludgeoning damage.
- Attacks with a magic stone have a magical bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your spellcasting ability modifier (rounded down).

The magic on a stone dissipates after it is used in an attack. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you choose to end it (no action required).
