## Description
You take a wooden branch, club, or staff that you are holding, and either hold it to the earth or raise it to the sky. You imbue the item with the power of nature and transform it into a formidable quarterstaff. The staff's magic lasts for the duration. The staff has the same statistics as a regular quarterstaff with the following changes:
- The quarterstaff deals magical bludgeoning damage.
- The quarterstaff has a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your wisdom modifier (rounded up).

If you let go of the quarterstaff, the magic dissipates, and the spell ends as the staff reverts to its original shape.
