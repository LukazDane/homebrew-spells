## Description
You take a wooden branch, club, or staff that you are holding, and either press it to the earth or raise it to the sky.
You imbue the item with the power of nature and transform it into a formidable polearm, which lasts for the duration.
The polearm has the same statistics as an ordinary *quarterstaff* with the following properties:
- The quarterstaff is considered magical.
- The quarterstaff has a magical bonus to Attack & Damage Rolls equal to half your Spellcasting Ability Modifier (rounded down).
- The quarterstaff can be used as a *druidic focus*.

This spell immediately ends if it is cast again before its duration expires, or if you let go of the quarterstaff.
The quarterstaff reverts to its original form once the spell ends.
