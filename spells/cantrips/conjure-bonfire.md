## Description
You conjure a continuous bonfire inside a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range.
The flames do not require any fuel to burn throughout the spell's duration.

When a creature moves through the bonfire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `1d6` fire damage.
Objects within the spell's area that aren't being worn or carried also take this damage.

Once per round, you can cause the bonfire to intensify as a bonus action.
Each creature within the flames must make the Saving Throw against the bonfire's damage.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level.
