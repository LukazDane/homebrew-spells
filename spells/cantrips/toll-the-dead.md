## Description
You point at one creature you can see within range. The sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it, which can be heard up to a mile away. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take this spell's necrotic damage, sloughing shreds of its spirit off its essence.

When this spell is first cast, it deals `1d4` necrotic damage. Each time this spell is cast within a mile of you before the end of the next round, the damage that this spell inflicts increases to the next tier of damage, as shown in the Damage Tiers table below.

#### Damage Tiers
| \# Castings | Damage Dice |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | `1d4`       |
| 2           | `1d6`       |
| 3           | `1d8`       |
| 4           | `1d10`      |
| 5           | `1d12`      |
| 6           | `1d16`      |
| 7+          | `1d20`      |

If this spell is not cast again within a mile of you before the end of the next round, the spell's damage resets to the first tier.
