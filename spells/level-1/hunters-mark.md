## Description
You mystically mark a creature you can see within range as your quarry.
Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `1d6` damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack and you have advantage on any ability check that you make to actively hunt it.
That includes activities such as:
- tracking
- searching
- pursuing
- capturing
- exterminating

If the target dies before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature within range.
If you do not do so within 5 minutes of the target's death, the spell ends early.

The spell ends early if you dismiss it (no action required).
A [*remove curse*](../level-3/remove-curse.md) or [*dispel magic*](../level-3/dispel-magic.md) spell also can end this spell early.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a higher level spell slot, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for much longer, as shown on the Enhanced Spell Duration table below.
