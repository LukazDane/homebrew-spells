## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
The weapon becomes a conduit for dark, thought-altering energies for the duration.
The first time you hit with an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it extends its insane influence upon your target, and the spell ends.
On a hit, the attack deals an extra `1d12` psychic damage.
It then must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **frightened** of you.

As an action, a **frightened** creature can repeat this Wisdom Saving Throw to overcome the fear, steeling its resolve against you and ending this spell's effects.
Otherwise, if a **frightened** ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can repeat this Wisdom save to muster its willpower against you.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with your weapon and miss.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
