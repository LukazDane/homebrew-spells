## Description
The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and contorting it into a temporary ward. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. In addition, every time you take damage of the triggering type before the spell ends, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage that you resist. These temporary hit points last until the end of your next turn.
