## Description
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you.
An aura of light appears to eminate from each source of magic in the area.
A more subtle presence may require a successful Wisdom Ability Check to notice.

If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or magical silence.
