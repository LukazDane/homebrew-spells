## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
The weapon sprouts enchanted stems and leaves that last until the end of your next turn.
The first time you make a Weapon Attack with this weapon before then, it unleashes a flurry of thorns that sprout from your weapon or ammunition, and the spell ends.
Hit or miss, each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the attack's intended point of impact must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `3d4` damage of the original attack's type.
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `2d4` for each slot level above 1st.
