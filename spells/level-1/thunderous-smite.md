## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
The weapon vibrates and rings with explosive potential for the duration.
The first time you hit with an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it releases a thunderous boom that is clearly audible within a mile of your target, and the spell ends.
On a hit, the attack deals an extra `4d4` thunder damage.
If the target is *large* or smaller, then it must also succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a ranged attack with your weapon and miss.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
