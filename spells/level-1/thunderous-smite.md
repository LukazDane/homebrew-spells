## Description
When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and hit your target, your weapon rings with thunder that is clearly audible within a mile of it, and the attack deals an extra `3d4` thunder damage to the target and pummels it backward, then the spell ends. Additionally, if the target is a creature of a Large size or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked **prone**. When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and miss your target, nothing happens unless it was a ranged weapon attack, in which case the spell ends.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again (no action required).
