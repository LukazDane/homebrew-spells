## Description
You perform a special religious ceremony that is infused with magic.
When you cast the spell, choose one of the following rites, the target of which must be within 10 feet of you for the spell's casting duration.
A creature can only have one lasting benefit from this spell at a time.

If you or the target of this spell does anything that clearly disrespects or corrupts the purpose of this sacred ritual, divine retribution may be cast upon you and any targets of this spell.
Such divine retribution can take any form (at the DM's discretion) and lasts 7 days.

### Atonement
You touch one willing creature and make a DC 20 Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the spell fails.
On a successful save, you shift the target's alignment by one degree in a direction of your choice.

### Bless Water
You touch one gallon of clean water and cause it to become *holy water*.
This is enough liquid to fill eight 16oz *glass bottles*.

### Coming of Age
You touch one willing creature who is a young adult.
For the next 7 days, the target gains a plus `1d4` bonus to all their Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, and Saving Throws for the duration.
A creature can benefit from this rite only once.

### Dedication
You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god's service.
For the next 7 days, the target has one bonus luck point, as described by the *lucky* feat.
This luck point regenerates after a long rest.
The target loses this ability after 7 days have passed.
A creature can benefit from this rite only once.

### Funeral Rite
You touch one corpse.
For the next 7 days, the target can't become undead by any means short of a [*wish*](../level-9/wish) spell.

### Investiture
You touch one willing humanoid.
Choose a spell of 1st-level or lower that you have prepared, and that has a casting time of an action or bonus action.
Expend a spell slot and any material components as if you were casting that spell.
The spell has no effect&mdash;instead, the target can cast this spell once without having to expend a spell slot or use material components.
If the target doesn't cast the spell within 7 days, the invested spell is lost.

### Wedding
You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage.
For the next 7 days, each target gains a `+5` bonus to AC while they are within 5 feet of each other.
A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed.
