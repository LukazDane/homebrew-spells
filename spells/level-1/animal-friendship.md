## Description
This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm.
Choose a beast that you can see within range.
The target must be able to see and hear you, and must be aware of you.
It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are hostile to it.
A creature with an Intelligence Score of `4` or higher automatically succeeds on its save.
On a failed save, the beast is **charmed** by you for the spell's duration.
If you or one of your companions harms the target, the charm on them ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.
