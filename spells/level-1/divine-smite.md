## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
The weapon releases a righteous light for the duration, as if [*light*](../cantrips/light.md) was cast on it, and eminates a high-pitch hum.
The first time you hit with an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it discharges its divine energy upon your target, and the spell ends.
On a hit, the attack deals an extra `2d8` radiant damage.
The extra damage increases by `1d8` if the target is an undead or fiend.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a ranged attack with your weapon and miss.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the attack increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 1st.
