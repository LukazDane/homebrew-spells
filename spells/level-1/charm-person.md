## Description
This spell lets you beguile a person, tricking them into genuinely believing that you are someone they know.
Choose a humanoid that you can see within range.
It must make a Wisdom Saving Throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are hostile to it.
On a failed save, the humanoid is **charmed** by you for the spell's duration.
A creature **charmed** in this way regards you as a friendly acquaintance.
If you or one of your companions harms the target, the charm on them ends.
When the spell ends, the creature knows it was **charmed** by you.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 1st.
