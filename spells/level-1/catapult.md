## Description
Choose an object within range that aren't being worn or carried.
The object must weigh less than 5 pounds in total, and fit in a 5-foot-long cube.
The bunch of objects flies in a straight line up to 60 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface.
If the barrage of objects would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the objects all strike the target and stop moving.
When the objects strike something, the bundle of objects and what it strikes each take `3d8` bludgeoning damage.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of the bunch of objects that you can target with this spell increases by 5 pounds, and the damage increases by `1d8`, for each slot level above 1st.
