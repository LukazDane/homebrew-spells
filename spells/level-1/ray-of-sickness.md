## Description
A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range.
Make a ranged spell attack against the target.
On a hit, the target takes `2d6` poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, it becomes **poisoned**.
While a creature is **poisoned** in this way, it is vulnerable to poison damage.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell produces one additional beam for each slot level above 1st.
You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones.
Make a separate attack roll for each beam.
