## Description
You create a magically sharp knife made of ice, formed from residual water in environment around you.
The knife forms in your free hand, and lasts for the duration.
The knife has the same statistics as a regular dagger with the following changes:
- The knife deals `2d4` cold or slashing damage (whichever is more effective).
- When thrown, the knife explodes into a cloud of ice shrapnal on impact.
	You can make a thrown weapon attack against a target as normal.
	Hit or miss, each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the attack's intended point of impact must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.
	On a failed save, a creature takes `2d6` cold or slashing damage (whichever is more effective).
	The spell then ends.

The spell ends if you let go of the dagger or cast this spell again.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the dagger's explosion damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
