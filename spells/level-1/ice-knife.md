## Description
You create a magically sharp dagger made of ice, formed from residual water in environment around you.
The dagger forms in your free hand, and lasts for the duration.
The dagger has the same statistics as a regular dagger with the following changes:
- The dagger deals `2d4` cold or slashing damage (whichever is more effective).
- When thrown, the dagger explodes into a cloud of ice shrapnal on impact.
	You can make a thrown weapon attack against a target as normal.
	Hit or miss, each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the dagger's point of impact must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `2d6` cold or slashing damage (whichever is more effective).
	The spell then ends.

If you let go of the dagger or cast this spell again, its edge and magic quickly deteriorates, and the spell ends at the end of your turn.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the dagger's explosion damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
