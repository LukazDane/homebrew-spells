## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding, and choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning or thunder.
You channel arcane energy of this type into your weapon.
Until the spell ends, attacks using this weapon deal an extra `1d6` damage of the chosen type, and are considered magical.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.

Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
