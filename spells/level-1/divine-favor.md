## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
You utter a prayer that washes over your weapon, etching it with divine markings.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already), and can be used as a *holy symbol*.
Until the spell ends, Weapon Attacks made using this weapon deal an extra `1d4` radiant damage on a hit.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
