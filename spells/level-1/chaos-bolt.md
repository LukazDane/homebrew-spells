## Description
You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range.
Make a ranged spell attack against the target.
On a hit, the target takes `3d6` damage.
Choose one of the `d6`s.
The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown on the Elemental Choices table below.

#### Elemental Choices
| `d6` | Damage Type                        |
|------|------------------------------------|
| 1    | Force                              |
| 2    | Acid                               |
| 3    | Thunder                            |
| 4    | Fire                               |
| 5    | Cold                               |
| 6    | Lightning                          |

If you roll two of the same numbers on any pair of `d6`s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it.
Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.
A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
