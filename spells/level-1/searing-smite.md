## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
For the duration, it glows red-hot, emitting dim light in a 10-foot radius.
Until the spell ends, the weapon is considered magical (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before then, it flares with white-hot intensity, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `2d6` fire damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The target must then succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or become **ignited** with flames.

As an action, an **ignited** creature can make a Dexterity Saving Throw to put out the flames, ending the effect on itself on a success.
A creature has advantage on this save if it is **prone**.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the attack increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
