## Description
When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and hit your target, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra `2d6` fire damage to the target and causes the target to burst into flames, then the spell ends. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Dexterity saving throw or be **immolated**. As an action, the target can repeat this Dexterity saving throw to end the condition. A creature has advantage on this saving throw if it is **prone**.

When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and miss your target, nothing happens unless it was a ranged weapon attack, in which case the spell ends. Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again (no action required).

***Immolated***
- An immolated creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the end of each of its turns.
- An immolated creature continues to burn until it submerges itself in water and thereby ends the condition.
- An affected creature automatically fails Dexterity ability checks.
- An affected creature has half speed.
