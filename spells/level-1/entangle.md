## Description
Grasping weeds and vines sprout from solid ground in a 20-foot cube originating from a point within range.
The vines reach upwards and outwards 5 feet.
For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When you cast the spell, each creature in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be **restrained** by the entangling plants for the duration.
As a action on your turn, you can command the area of plants to ensnare its occupants once again.
A creature **restrained** by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.
On a success, it frees itself.

When the spell ends, the conjured plants greatly retract into the earth and root themselves there as ordinary foliage.
