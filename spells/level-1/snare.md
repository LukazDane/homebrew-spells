**Duration:** 12 hours

**Range:** touch

**Tags:** verbal, somatic, material

**Material Components:** 30 feet of rope worth atleast 60 cp, which the spell consumes

## Description
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor.
When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Wisdom check against your spell save DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius.
That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor.
The creature is **restrained** there until the spell ends.

A **restrained** creature can use an action to make a Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence check against your spell save DC.
On a success, the **restrained** effect ends.

After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is **restrained** by it.
