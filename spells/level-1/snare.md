***1st-level abjuration***

**Casting Time:** 5 minutes

**Duration:** 12 hours

**Range:** touch

**Tags:** verbal, somatic, material

**Material Components:** 30 feet of rope worth atleast 60 cp, which the spell consumes

## Description
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle on the ground or the floor.
When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

Choose the size of the trap: *small*, *medium*, *large*, or *huge*.
The rope magically transforms to match the size that your chose for the trap.
This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Wisdom Ability Check against your Spell Save DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a creature of the same size as the trap moves onto the ground or floor in the spell's radius.
The trap also triggers for creatures that are one size larger or smaller than the trap.
That creature must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor.
The creature is **restrained** there until the spell ends.

A **restrained** creature can use an action to make a Dexterity Saving Throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence Ability Check against your Spell Save DC.
On a success, the **restrained** effect ends.

After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is **restrained** by it.
