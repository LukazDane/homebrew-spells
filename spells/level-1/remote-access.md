## Description
This spell allows you to use any device within range as if you were operating it normally.
The device's control panel must be able to fit within a 10-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range.
This is not a telekinetic effect; rather, the magic allows you to simulate a device's mechanical functions programmatically.
You are able to access only functions that a person using the device manually would be able to access.

You can use remote access with only one device at a time.
The spell ends if you are ever more than 120 feet away from the device.
