## Description
A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range.
Make a Ranged Spell Attack against the target.
On a hit, the target takes `4d6` radiant damage, and creates glittery particles in the target's space.
The particles emit a dim light in a 10-foot aura until the end of your next turn.
Until then, attacks made against the target within 10 feet of it have advantage, thanks to the risidual divine energy propelling strikes against it, and it can't benefit from being **invisible**.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
