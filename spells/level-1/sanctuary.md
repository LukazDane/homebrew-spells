## Description
You ward one willing creature within range against harmful effects.
For the duration, the target has a Damage Threshold (DT) of `5`.
When this spell's recipient is targeted by an attack, spell, or ability, they can choose to flip `a coin`.
On a `heads`, they are not affected by the action.

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an unwilling creature, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends early.
The spell also ends early if the creature takes any other action that is deemed harmful to any other creature (at the DM's discretion).
