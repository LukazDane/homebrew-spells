## Description
You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell protects the warded creature from area affects by granting it advantage on all saving throws.

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects a hostile creature, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.
