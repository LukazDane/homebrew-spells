## Description
You attempt to curse up to five creatures of your choice within range.
Each creature must make a Charima throw.
On a successful save, the target resists the spell; however, you can choose to target it again with this casting.
If you do so, you must count it multiple times against the number of creatures that you have chosen to target with this spell.
On a failed save, the target is cursed.
Whenever a target that fails this Saving Throw makes an Attack Roll or a Saving Throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a `d4` and subtract the number rolled from the Attack Roll or Saving Throw.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
