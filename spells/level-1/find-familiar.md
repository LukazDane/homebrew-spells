## Description
You gain the service of a bound spirit that hails from another plane of existance.
Typically, this spirit come from the Feywild, the Nine Hells, or Elysium.
When you cast this spell, this immortal entity is mystically selected and bonded to you.

Once your companion spirit is selected, you channel it into a beast that you must hold or touch for the spell's casting duration.
This spell can only affect limited selection of animals (at the DM's discretion, other animals might be available):
- bats
- cats
- crabs
- frogs or toads
- hawks
- lizards
- octopuses
- owls
- snakes
- fish or quippers
- rats
- ravens
- sea horses
- spiders
- weasels

When the spell completes, it fuses your companion spirit with the animal's body.
A mystic symbiosis forms, creating a familiar&mdash;boosting the animal's self-awareness, and gifting the bound spirit with a new mortal form.
Your familiar keeps the statistics of its chosen form and is **charmed** by you.

While your familiar is **charmed** by you in this way, you form a telepathic link with it while you are within 120 feet of one another.
Through the link, your familiar can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you.
Once per round, you can use your bonus action to issue commands to the beast through the link, and it obeys as best as it can.
Otherwise, your familiar acts on its own, focusing on protecting itself and you.
Your familiar rolls its own initiative, however it can choose to take its turn directly after you on your initiative count.

You can use your action to see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses.
During this time, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by your familiar, though you are **blinded**, **deafened**, and **stunned** as your body reels from temporarily shutting down.
Also as an action, you can cause your familiar to teleport to any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, or to a safe location that you are both familiar with.
Any items that the familiar is carrying are not teleported with it.

When you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell.
Your familiar must be within 120 feet of you, and it must use its action to deliver the spell when you cast it.
If the spell requires an attack roll or saving throw, you use your spell attack modifier or Spell Save DC for the roll.

You can't have more than one familiar at a time.
If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you can transfer your bound spirit to the new target animal, causing your familiar to adopt a new form.
When your familiar drops to 0 hit points, the animal dies, and your companion spirit drifts to its home plane until you cast this spell again.
