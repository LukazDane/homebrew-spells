## Description
You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain.
The target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, it takes `3d6` psychic damage and becomes **frightened** of you until the end of your next turn.
While a creature is **frightened** in this way, it cannot use reactions, and must use its movement to move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move.
The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.
On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage isn't **frightened**.
A **deafened** creature automatically succeeds on the save.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
