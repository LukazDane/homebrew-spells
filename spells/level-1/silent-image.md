## Description
You create a convincingly realistic image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot-long cube.
The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration.
You have full control over the image's animation within its space.
The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

You can cause the image to move to any spot within range at any time (no action required).
As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.
For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
You can also adjust the percieved physics of the image, such as how wind and gravity interacts with it.
Detailed arrangements, like flowing cloaks, water, and hair are intuitively taken care of through your magic.

Physical collision with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
A creature that uses its action to examine or interact with the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence check against your spell save DC.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.
