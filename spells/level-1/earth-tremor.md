## Description
A ground-shaking tremor forming a 30-foot-long, 15-foot-wide line shoots from you across the earth.
Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage and is knocked **prone**.
A creature who is flying or is not grounded on a solid surface automatically succeeds on this save.
If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
