## Description
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against one type of creature of your choice from the following: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. When the target is affected by an attack, spell, or ability by a creature of the chosen type, they must flip a coin. On a tails, the target is affected as normal. On a heads, the target is protected from the action, and is not affected. The target also can't be **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by them. If the target is already **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
