## Description
Until the spell ends, one object or willing creature you touch is protected against one type of creature of your choice from the following: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits.
When a creature of the chosen type targets this spell's recipient with an attack, spell, or ability, they must flip `a coin`.
On a `tails`, the target is not affected by the action.
If the target is a creature, they can't be **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by them.
If the target is already **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new Saving Throw against the relevant effect.
