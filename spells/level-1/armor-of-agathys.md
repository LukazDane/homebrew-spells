A protective magical force surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear.
You gain `2d4` temporary hit points for the duration.
If a creature hits you with a Melee Attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes `2d4` cold damage.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the cold damage increase by `2d4` for each slot level above 1st.
