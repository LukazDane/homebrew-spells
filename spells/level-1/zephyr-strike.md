## Description
You move like the wind. When you first cast the spell, and then as a bonus action on your next turn, you take on the effects of both the **dash** and **disengage** actions.

Once before the end of your next turn, you can give yourself advantage on one weapon attack roll. That attack deals an extra `1d12` force damage on a hit.
