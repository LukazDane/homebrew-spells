## Description
This spell envelops creatures and objects in the area with an outline of glittering blue, green, or violet light (your choice).
Roll `7d12`; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect.
Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring **unconscious** creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is outlined in a glittering light until the spell ends.
Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points.
A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Inanimate objects and **unconscious** creatures in the spell's area are always affected by this magic, regardless of their hit points.

For the duration, affected objects and creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot-radius aura.
Attacks made against an affected target within 10 feet of it have advantage, thanks to the risidual arcane energy, and an affected creature or object can't benefit from being **invisible**.

An affected creature can use its action to make a Dexterity Saving Throw to attempt to shake off the glowing magic placed upon it.
On a success, the magic ends for that creature.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional `2d12` for each slot level above 1st.
