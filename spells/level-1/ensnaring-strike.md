## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It sprouts enchanted stems and leaves that last until the end of your next turn.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you make an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it sprays a net of clinging brambles at your target, and the spell ends.
If the attack hits, it deals an extra `2d6` slashing damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
Hit or miss, the target creture must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw.
On a failed save, it becomes **restrained** by magical brambles.
A *huge* or larger creature has advantage on this Saving Throw.

While **restrained** by this spell, a creature takes `1d6` slashing damage at the end of each of its turns.
A creature **restrained** by the vines can use its action to repeat the Strength Saving Throw.
On a successful save, the target is freed.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the initial and sustained damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
