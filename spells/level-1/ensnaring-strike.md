## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding. The weapon is bathed in magic, sprouting enchanted stems and leaves that last until the end of your next turn. The first time you make an attack with this weapon before then, a net of clinging brambles sprays from your weapon or ammunition. Hit or miss, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, that creature takes `2d6` slashing damage and becomes **restrained** by magical brambles. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and isn't restrained.

While **restrained** by this spell, the target takes `1d6` slashing damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature **restrained** by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the initial and sustained damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
