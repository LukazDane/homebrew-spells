## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
The weapon sprouts enchanted stems and leaves that last until the end of your next turn.
The first time you make an attack with this weapon before then, a net of clinging brambles sprays from your weapon or ammunition, and the spell ends.
If the attack hits, it deals an extra `1d6` slashing damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
Hit or miss, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw.
On a failed save, that creature becomes **restrained** by magical brambles.
A *huge* or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw.

While **restrained** by this spell, a creature takes `1d6` slashing damage at the end of each of its turns.
A creature **restrained** by the vines can use its action to repeat the Strength saving throw.
On a successful save, the target is freed.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.
When the spell ends, the conjured brambles greatly retract into the earth and root themselves there as ordinary foliage.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the initial and sustained damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
