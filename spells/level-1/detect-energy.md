## Description
For the duration, you sense the presence of divine energy fields within 30 feet of you.
A more subtle presence may require a successful Wisdom check to even notice.

If you sense energy fields in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any creature or object in the area that bears a divine presence, and you learn thier alignment, if any.

Doing so reveals any creature that is an abberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead&mdash;as well as their location within the spell's area.

In addition, you know if there is a place or object within the spell's area that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or magical silence.

> These energy fields are typically laced with divine powers of good, evil, law, and chaos.
> However, neutral energies remain imperceptible, even by this spell.
> 
> Humanoids, beasts and other mundane creatures generally emit weak and barely noticeable auras.
> Conversely, interplanar visitors often exude colorful and readily apparent auras.
