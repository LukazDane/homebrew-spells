## Description
For the duration, you sense the presence of divine energy fields within 30 feet of you.
An aura of divine patterns appears to eminate from each source of energy in the area.
A more subtle presence may require a successful Wisdom ability check to notice.

If you sense energy fields in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any creature or object in the area that bears a divine presence, and you learn thier alignment, if any.

Doing so reveals any creature that is an abberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead&mdash;as well as their location within the spell's area.

In addition, you know if there is a place or object within the spell's area that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or magical silence.

> These energy fields are typically laced with divine powers of good, evil, law, and chaos.
> However, neutral energies remain imperceptible, even by this spell.
> 
> Humanoids, beasts and other mundane creatures generally emit weak and barely noticeable auras because of this.
> Conversely, interplanar visitors often exude colorful and readily apparent auras.
