## Description
You invoke the power of Hadar&mdash;the Dark Hunger&mdash;and tendrils of dark energy erupt from you.
Each creature other than you within a 10-foot-radius aura eminating from you must make a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `2d6` necrotic damage.

In addition, when you cast this spell, the dark shroud of energy gives you the benefits of taking the *disengage* action.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
