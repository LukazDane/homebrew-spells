## Description
You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot-long cube originating from a point you choose within range.
Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.
Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage.
A creature takes `12d8` necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.
